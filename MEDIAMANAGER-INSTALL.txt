# Installation instructions for Media Manager 2.0
#

Thank you for downloading Media Manager. Below are the manual install 
instructions for one of Movable Type's most popular plugins.

Before we proceed, make sure each of the following prerequisites have
been satisfied.

PREREQUISITES

  * User has MovableType 4.01 or greater installed
  * User has LWP installed
  * User must have a Amazon Web Services Subscription ID or
    developer token

INSTALLATION

1) Install Media Manager's files.

   To install Media Manager, unpack the Media Manager archive. Then
   copy the contents of Media Manager's mt-static directory into 
   Movable Type's mt-static directory:

   > cp -pR MediaManager-2.0/mt-static/* /path/to/mt/mt-static/

   Then copy the contents of Media Manager's plugins folder to 
   Movable Type's plugins folder:

   > cp -pR MediaManager-2.0/plugins/* /path/to/mt/plugins/

   In the event that you are unable to unpack Media Manager's archive
   directly on the server, you may need to install the files manually.
   To do this, each of Media Manager's files needs to be placed in a
   specific directory, as outlined below:

     plugins/MediaManager/lib/MediaManager/*  
           ==> $MTHOME/plugins/MediaManager/lib/MediaManager/
     plugins/MediaManager/lib/MTAmazon3/*     
           ==> $MTHOME/plugins/MediaManager/lib/MTAmazon3/
     plugins/MediaManager/lib/XML/*           
           ==> $MTHOME/plugins/MediaManager/lib/XML/
     plugins/MediaManager/tmpl/*              
           ==> $MTHOME/plugins/MediaManager/tmpl/
     plugins/MediaManager/MediaManager.pl     
           ==> $MTHOME/plugins/MediaManager/MediaManager.pl
     plugins/MediaManager/MTAmazon.pl         
           ==> $MTHOME/plugins/MediaManager/MTAmazon.pl

     The following files are static files and must be placed in your static
     web path. By default this is $MTHOME/mt-static.

     mt-static/plugins/MediaManager/images/*
           ==> $MTHOME/mt-static/plugins/MediaManager/images
     mt-static/plugins/MediaManager/js/*
           ==> $MTHOME/mt-static/plugins/MediaManager/js
     mt-static/plugins/MediaManager/styles/*
           ==> $MTHOME/mt-static/plugins/MediaManager/styles

2) Set Your StaticWebPath.

   Media Manager has a number of javascript, css and image files that must
   be accessible via a web browser. If Media Manager appears unstyled, or
   if you are receiving javascript errors, it may be the result of your
   static web path not being set properly.

   To change your static web path, open up your mt-config.cgi file and look 
   for the following lines:

     # If you place all of your MT files in a cgi-bin directory, you
     # will need to place the directory containing your static files
     # (mt-static) elsewhere, so that the webserver will not try to execute
     # them.  StaticWebPath is the path to your mt-static directory.
     #
     # StaticWebPath http://www.example.com/mt-static

   Set the value of StaticWebPath to the fully qualified URL of your
   mt-static directory.

3) Get an Amazon Web Services account. 

   Visit the following URL and sign up for an Amazon Web Services 
   account.

   Once you signed up, you will need to retrieve your "AWS Access 
   Identifiers." Specifically you will need your "Access Key ID." Your
   Access Key ID should be a 20 character string, similar to the
   following:

     4FNWS2WS61241WGETX83

   Save this Access Key ID to your clipboard. You will need it again
   when configuring Media Manager.

4) When you access Movable Type for the first time after successfully
   installing Media Manager, Movable Type will prompt you to upgrade
   or install Media Manager. Click "Continue" until you are finished
   and Movable Type returns you to the application.

5) Configure Media Manager and MTAmazon.

   Finally, you will need to navigate to the Plugins tab located
   under your System or Blog "Settings" menu area. From there you
   can find MTAmazon among your list of plugins (located in the
   list as a "Media Manager Plugin Set"). Click "Show Settings" and 
   enter values for the following as appropriate:

     * Amazon Associates ID
     * Amazon Access Key ID
     * Your Locale (US, Japan, France, etc)
